### Project Summary

In this project, i implemented a simple terraform script to create a VPC, Subnet, Security Group, and an EC2 instance in AWS. The script is written in HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) and is used to automate the process of creating the infrastructure.

### Learning Journey

I think the best way to learn any new technology is to by first understanding the idea behind it and where it fits in the grand scheme of things. In this case, Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a high-level configuration language. It is a declarative language that allows you to define the desired state of your infrastructure and Terraform will take care of the rest. In this case, the best option for me was to go to udemy and start preparing for my hashicorp terraform certification. I started with the basics and then moved on to more advanced topics. I also did some hands-on labs to get a better understanding of the concepts. I also read the official documentation to get a better understanding of the concepts.

### Reflections

I think Terraform is a great tool for automating the process of creating infrastructure. It is easy to learn and use and has a large community of users. I think it is a great tool for anyone who wants to automate the process of creating infrastructure in the cloud. I am looking forward to using Terraform in my future projects and learning more about it.
